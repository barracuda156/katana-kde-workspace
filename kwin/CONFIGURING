1. Pre-configuring window-specific settings
===========================================

Window-specific settings is a feature of KWin that allows specifying some
settings only for a specific window or windows. See the Window-specific
settings section in the KWin configuration and the Special settings
menu entries in Alt+F3/Advanced menu.

One aspect of window-specific settings is the ability to specify various
workarounds for (usually broken) applications that otherwise don't work
properly with KWin. This section describes how to create additional
window-specific settings that will be automatically used by all users
without any need of manual configuration.

Example case:

Application FooBar does not specify any maximum size for its main window,
but when resized to larger size than 1600x1200 it crashes because of a bug.
Manual configuration of a window-specific setting that avoids this problem
is opening and activating this window, selecting
Alt+F3/Advanced/Special window settings, activating tab Workarounds, enabling
setting Maximum size, changing it to Force and entering "1600,1200" as
the maximum size, which will make KWin force this size as the maximum size.

To create such window-specific setting automatically without a need of doing
it manually for every user create file with the window-specific settings in
$KDEDIR/share/apps/kwin/default_rules/

All KDE user accounts should have these new window-specific settings added
automatically during next KDE startup (or within few seconds if they are active).
They can be checked again in the Window-specific settings configuration module of KWin.
