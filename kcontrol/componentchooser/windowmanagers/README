The list of window managers that the config module offers for using.
The format is normal .desktop files:

Name - required, name to display in the configuration dialog.

Exec - required, the command to execute to launch the window manager.
    If launching fails for any reason, it must quit with non-zero exit
    value and not do anything else (show an error dialog, try to run
    a fallback, etc.).
    
TryExec - optional.

X-KDE-WindowManagerConfigure - optional, the command to run to configure
    the window manager

X-KDE-WindowManagerConfigureParentArgument - option, if present, this
    argument and the X window id of the configuration dialog will be passed
    to the configuration command (e.g. '--parent 13254543'). The configuration
    tool may specify this window as the parent of its window.
