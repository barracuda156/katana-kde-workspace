GENERAL
=======

In KDE we support localization of calendars, dates, time, numbers. KDE will use
this when displaying your language . Currently there are some 237 countries
supported. If your country is missing, please let us know.

The official ISO codes unsupported as at 18/11/2008 are:

    * AQ Antarctica
    * BV Bouvet Island
    * GS South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands
    * HM Heard Island and MacDonald Islands
    * IO British Indian Ocean Territory
    * SJ Svalbard and Jan Mayen
    * TF French Southern Territories
    * UM United States Minor Outlying Islands

Of these, the following codes are likely to be considered for support:

    * SJ Svalbard and Jan Mayen

The other codes are unlikely to be considered due to lack of population.

HOW TO ADD INFORMATION
======================
First you have to write a file called "entry.desktop". This file will
be used to translate the language. Please use the file "country.template" as
template.

You will need a nice flag for your country. The size should be 21x14
pixels, and it should be called "flag.png".

To add your information, we need a two letter country code for you country.
Use http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/ or the entities.csv document in
this folder as a guide.

Now you are done, and you can submit the files to KDE project by adding a wish
item on bugs.kde.org under Product kdelibs Componant KLocale. The files will be
added in the next release.

WHAT IS ENTRY.DESKTOP
=====================
entry.desktop is a file which defines a locale for a country. It's
stored the same way as the rest of the KDE configuration files. The
very first line should only contain "[KCM Locale]". The rest of the
file should contain one line for each of the entries below. Add "="
between the entry name and the value.

* Author
	The name of the email address to reach you.

	Default: blank

* Name
	The name of the country in English.

	Default: blank
