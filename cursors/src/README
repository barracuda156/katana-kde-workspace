How to generate all the pngs and the SVGs and the cursor files:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src
make [theme-<color>|package-<color>]

Where <color> is the color you want generated if you want just one of them.

The build system is still young, with rough edges (e.g. doesn't check if
inkscape is found). Hopefully it will work, but there may still be problems.

All of what you see here is to be considered a work in progress, and therefore
must be considered as unreleased.
